New Features
============

    Configuration:
    -------------
    - Add toolchain and cross-compile support

      Added info on using a toolchain file to INSTALL_CMAKE.txt. A
      toolchain file is also used in cross-compiling, which requires
      CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR to be set. To help with cross-compiling
      the fortran configure process, the HDF5UseFortran.cmake file macros
      were improved. Fixed a Fortran configure file issue that incorrectly
      used #cmakedefine instead of #define.

      (ADB - 2018/10/04, HDFFV-10594)

    - Add warning flags for Intel compilers

      Identified Intel compiler specific warnings flags that should be used
      instead of GNU flags.

      (ADB - 2018/10/04, TRILABS-21)

    - Add default rpath to targets

      Default rpaths should be set in shared executables and
      libraries to allow the use of loading dependent libraries
      without requiring LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set. The default
      path should be relative using @rpath on osx and $ORIGIN
      on linux. Windows is not affected.

      (ADB - 2018/09/26, HDFFV-10594)

    - Add missing USE_110_API_DEFAULT option.

      Option USE_110_API_DEFAULT sets the default version of
      versioned APIs. The bin/makevers perl script did not set
      the maxidx variable correctly when the 1.10 branch was
      created. This caused the versioning process to always use
      the latest version of any API.

      (ADB - 2018/08/17, HDFFV-10552)

    - Added configuration checks for the following MPI functions:

      MPI_Mprobe - Used for the Parallel Compression feature
      MPI_Imrecv - Used for the Parallel Compression feature

      MPI_Get_elements_x - Used for the "big Parallel I/O" feature
      MPI_Type_size_x - Used for the "big Parallel I/O" feature

      (JTH - 2018/08/02, HDFFV-10512)

    - Added section to the libhdf5.settings file to indicate
      the status of the Parallel Compression and "big Parallel I/O"
      features.

      (JTH - 2018/08/02, HDFFV-10512)

    - Add option to execute swmr shell scripts from CMake.

      Option TEST_SHELL_SCRIPTS redirects processing into a
      separate ShellTests.cmake file for UNIX types. The tests
      execute the shell scripts if a SH program is found.

      (ADB - 2018/07/16)


    - Incorrectly installed private header files were removed from
      CMake installs.

      The CMake build files incorrectly flagged the following header files
      as public and installed them. They are private and will no longer be
      installed.

        HDF5 library private package files (H5Xpkg.h)
        H5Edefin.h
        H5Einit.h
        H5Eterm.h
        H5LTparse.h
        h5diff.h
        h5tools_dump.h
        h5tools.h
        h5tools_ref.h
        h5tools_str.h
        h5tools_utils.h
        h5trav.h

      (DER - 2018/10/26, HDFFV-10614, 10609)
      
    - Autotools installs now install H5FDwindows.h

      This is simply to align the installed header files between the
      autotools and CMake. H5FDwindows.h has no functionality on
      non-Windows systems.

      (DER - 2018/10/26, HDFFV-10614)

 
    Library:
    --------
    - Allow pre-generated H5Tinit.c and H5make_libsettings.c to be used.

      Rather than always running H5detect and generating H5Tinit.c and
      H5make_libsettings.c, supply a location for those files.

      (ADB - 2018/09/18, HDFFV-10332)


    - Several empty public header files where removed from the distribution

      The following files were empty placeholders. They are for internal
      packages that are unlikely to ever have public functionality and have
      thus been removed.

        H5Bpublic.h
        H5B2public.h
        H5FSpublic.h
        H5HFpublic.h
        H5HGpublic.h
        H5HLpublic.h

      They were only installed in CMake builds.

    - New wrappers

      Added the following items:

      + Class DSetAccPropList for the dataset access property list.

      + Wrapper for H5Dget_access_plist to class DataSet
        // Gets the access property list of this dataset.
        DSetAccPropList getAccessPlist() const;

      + Wrappers for H5Pset_chunk_cache and H5Pget_chunk_cache to class DSetAccPropList
        // Sets the raw data chunk cache parameters.
        void setChunkCache(size_t rdcc_nslots, size_t rdcc_nbytes, double rdcc_w0)

        // Retrieves the raw data chunk cache parameters.
        void getChunkCache(size_t &rdcc_nslots, size_t &rdcc_nbytes, double &rdcc_w0)

      + New operator!= to class DataType (HDFFV-10472)
        // Determines whether two datatypes are not the same.
        bool operator!=(const DataType& compared_type)

      + Wrappers for H5Oget_info2, H5Oget_info_by_name2, and H5Oget_info_by_idx2
        (HDFFV-10458)

        // Retrieves information about an HDF5 object.
        void getObjinfo(H5O_info_t& objinfo, unsigned fields = H5O_INFO_BASIC) const;

        // Retrieves information about an HDF5 object, given its name.
        void getObjinfo(const char* name, H5O_info_t& objinfo,
                unsigned fields = H5O_INFO_BASIC,
                const LinkAccPropList& lapl = LinkAccPropList::DEFAULT) const;
        void getObjinfo(const H5std_string& name, H5O_info_t& objinfo,
                unsigned fields = H5O_INFO_BASIC,
                const LinkAccPropList& lapl = LinkAccPropList::DEFAULT) const;

        // Retrieves information about an HDF5 object, given its index.
        void getObjinfo(const char* grp_name, H5_index_t idx_type,
                H5_iter_order_t order, hsize_t idx, H5O_info_t& objinfo,
                unsigned fields = H5O_INFO_BASIC,
                const LinkAccPropList& lapl = LinkAccPropList::DEFAULT) const;
        void getObjinfo(const H5std_string& grp_name, H5_index_t idx_type,
                H5_iter_order_t order, hsize_t idx, H5O_info_t& objinfo,
                unsigned fields = H5O_INFO_BASIC,
                const LinkAccPropList& lapl = LinkAccPropList::DEFAULT) const;

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.10.3 release
==================================

    Library
    -------
    - Allow H5detect and H5make_libsettings to take a file as an argument.

      Rather than only writing to stdout, add a command argument to name
      the file that H5detect and H5make_libsettings will use for output.
      Without an argument, stdout is still used, so backwards compatibility
      is maintained.

      (ADB - 2018/09/05, HDFFV-9059)

    - A bug was discovered in the parallel library where an application
      would hang if a collective read/write of a chunked dataset occurred
      when collective metadata reads were enabled and some of the ranks
      had no selection in the dataset's dataspace. The ranks which had no
      selection in the dataset's dataspace called H5D__chunk_addrmap() to
      retrieve the lowest chunk address in the dataset. This is because we
      require reads/writes to be performed in strictly non-decreasing order
      of chunk address in the file.

      When the chunk index used was a version 1 or 2 B-tree, these
      non-participating ranks would issue a collective MPI_Bcast() call
      that the participating ranks would not issue, causing the hang. Since
      the non-participating ranks are not actually reading/writing anything,
      the H5D__chunk_addrmap() call can be safely removed and the address used
      for the read/write can be set to an arbitrary number (0 was chosen).

      (JTH - 2018/08/25, HDFFV-10501)

    Java Library:
    ----------------
    - JNI native library dependencies

      The build for the hdf5_java native library used the wrong
      hdf5 target library for CMake builds. Correcting the hdf5_java
      library to build with the shared hdf5 library required testing
      paths to change also.

      (ADB - 2018/08/31, HDFFV-10568)
     - Java iterator callbacks

      Change global callback object to a small stack structure in order
      to fix a runtime crash. This crash was discovered when iterating
      through a file with nested group members. The global variable
      visit_callback is overwritten when recursion starts. When recursion
      completes, visit_callback will be pointing to the wrong callback method.

      (ADB - 2018/08/15, HDFFV-10536)

    - Java HDFLibraryException class

      Change parent class from Exception to RuntimeException.

      (ADB - 2018/07/30, HDFFV-10534)

    - JNI Read and Write

      Refactored variable-length functions, H5DreadVL and H5AreadVL,
      to correct dataset and attribute reads. New write functions,
      H5DwriteVL and H5AwriteVL, are under construction.

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.10.2 release
==================================

    Library
    -------
    - Java HDF5LibraryException class

      The error minor and major values would be lost after the
      constructor executed.

      Created two local class variables to hold the values obtained during
      execution of the constructor. Refactored the class functions to retrieve
      the class values rather then calling the native functions.
      The native functions were renamed and called only during execution
      of the constructor.
      Added error checking to calling class constructors in JNI classes.

      (ADB - 2018/08/06, HDFFV-10544)

    - Added checks of the defined MPI_VERSION to guard against usage of
      MPI-3 functions in the Parallel Compression and "big Parallel I/O"
      features when HDF5 is built with MPI-2. Previously, the configure
      step would pass but the build itself would fail when it could not
      locate the MPI-3 functions used.

      As a result of these new checks, HDF5 can again be built with MPI-2,
      but the Parallel Compression feature will be disabled as it relies
      on the MPI-3 functions used.

    - User's patches: CVEs

      The following patches have been applied:

      CVE-2018-11202 - NULL pointer dereference was discovered in

    - H5Adelete

      H5Adelete failed when deleting the last "large" attribute that
      is stored densely via fractal heap/v2 b-tree.

      After removing the attribute, update the ainfo message.  If the
      number of attributes goes to zero, remove the message.

      (VC - 2018/07/20, HDFFV-9277)

    - A bug was discovered in the parallel library which caused partial
      parallel reads of filtered datasets to return incorrect data. The
      library used the incorrect dataspace for each chunk read, causing
      the selection used in each chunk to be wrong.

      The bug was not caught during testing because all of the current
      tests which do parallel reads of filtered data read all of the data
      using an H5S_ALL selection. Several tests were added which exercise
      partial parallel reads.

      (JTH - 2018/07/16, HDFFV-10467)

    - A bug was discovered in the parallel library which caused parallel
      writes of filtered datasets to trigger an assertion failure in the
      file free space manager.

      This occurred when the filter used caused chunks to repeatedly shrink
      and grow over the course of several dataset writes. The previous chunk
      information, such as the size of the chunk and the offset in the file,
      was being cached and not updated after each write, causing the next write
      to the chunk to retrieve the incorrect cached information and run into
      issues when reallocating space in the file for the chunk.

      (JTH - 2018/07/16, HDFFV-10509)

    - A bug was discovered in the parallel library which caused the
      H5D__mpio_array_gatherv() function to allocate too much memory.

      When the function is called with the 'allgather' parameter set
      to a non-true value, the function will receive data from all MPI
      ranks and gather it to the single rank specied by the 'root'
      parameter. However, the bug in the function caused memory for
      the received data to be allocated on all MPI ranks, not just the
      singular rank specified as the receiver. In some circumstances,
      this would cause an application to fail due to the large amounts
      of memory being allocated.

      (JTH - 2018/07/16, HDFFV-10467)

    - Error checks in h5stat and when decoding messages

      h5stat exited with seg fault/core dumped when
      errors are encountered in the internal library.

      Add error checks and --enable-error-stack option to h5stat.
      Add range checks when decoding messages: old fill value, old
      layout and refcount.

      (VC - 2018/07/11, HDFFV-10333)

    - If an HDF5 file contains a malformed compound datatype with a
      suitably large offset, the type conversion code can run off
      the end of the type conversion buffer, causing a segmentation
      fault.

      This issue was reported to The HDF Group as issue #CVE-2017-17507.

      NOTE: The HDF5 C library cannot produce such a file. This condition
            should only occur in a corrupt (or deliberately altered) file
            or a file created by third-party software.

      THE HDF GROUP WILL NOT FIX THIS BUG AT THIS TIME

      Fixing this problem would involve updating the publicly visible
      H5T_conv_t function pointer typedef and versioning the API calls
      which use it. We normally only modify the public API during
      major releases, so this bug will not be fixed at this time.

      (DER - 2018/02/26, HDFFV-10356)

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Applied patches to address Cywin build issues

      There were three issues for Cygwin builds:
      - Shared libs were not built.
      - The -std=c99 flag caused a SIG_SETMASK undeclared error.
      - Undefined errors when buildbing test shared libraries.

      Patches to address these issues were received and incorporated in this version.

      (LRK - 2018/07/18, HDFFV-10475)

    - The --enable-debug/production configure flags are listed as 'deprecated'
      when they should really be listed as 'removed'.

      In the autotools overhaul several years ago, we removed these flags and
      implemented a new --enable-build-mode= flag. This was done because we
      changed the semantics of the modes and didn't want users to silently
      be exposed to them. The newer system is also more flexible and us to
      add other modes (like 'clean').

      The --enable-debug/production flags are now listed as removed.

      (DER - 2018/05/31, HDFFV-10505)

    - Moved the location of gcc attribute.

      The gcc attribute(no_sanitize), named as the macro HDF_NO_UBSAN,
      was located after the function name. Builds with GCC 7 did not
      indicate any problem, but GCC 8 issued errors. Moved the
      attribute before the function name, as required.

      (ADB - 2018/05/22, HDFFV-10473)

    - Reworked java test suite into individual JUnit tests.

      Testing the whole suite of java unit tests in a single JUnit run
      made it difficult to determine actual failures when tests would fail.
      Running each file set of tests individually, allows individual failures
      to be diagnosed easier. A side benefit is that tests for optional components
      of the library can be disabled if not configured.

      (ADB - 2018/05/16, HDFFV-9739)

    - Converted CMake global commands ADD_DEFINITIONS and INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
      to use target_* type commands. This change modernizes the CMake usage
      in the HDF5 library.

      In addition, there is the intention to convert to generator expressions,
      where possible. The exception is Fortran FLAGS on Windows Visual Studio.
      The HDF macros TARGET_C_PROPERTIES and TARGET_FORTRAN_PROPERTIES have
      been removed with this change in usage.

      The additional language (C++ and Fortran) checks have also been localized
      to only be checked when that language is enabled.

Known Problems
==============

    At present, metadata cache images may not be generated by parallel
    applications.  Parallel applications can read files with metadata cache
    images, but since this is a collective operation, a deadlock is possible
    if one or more processes do not participate.

    Known problems in previous releases can be found in the HISTORY*.txt files
    in the HDF5 source. Please report any new problems found to
    help@hdfgroup.org.


CMake vs. Autotools installations
=================================
While both build systems produce similar results, there are differences.
Each system produces the same set of folders on linux (only CMake works
on standard Windows); bin, include, lib and share. Autotools places the
COPYING and RELEASE.txt file in the root folder, CMake places them in
the share folder.

The bin folder contains the tools and the build scripts. Additionally, CMake
creates dynamic versions of the tools with the suffix "-shared". Autotools
installs one set of tools depending on the "--enable-shared" configuration
option.
  build scripts
  -------------
  Autotools: h5c++, h5cc, h5fc
  CMake: h5c++, h5cc, h5hlc++, h5hlcc

The include folder holds the header files and the fortran mod files. CMake
places the fortran mod files into separate shared and static subfolders,
while Autotools places one set of mod files into the include folder. Because
CMake produces a tools library, the header files for tools will appear in
the include folder.

The lib folder contains the library files, and CMake adds the pkgconfig
subfolder with the hdf5*.pc files used by the bin/build scripts created by
the CMake build. CMake separates the C interface code from the fortran code by
creating C-stub libraries for each Fortran library. In addition, only CMake
installs the tools library. The names of the szip libraries are different
between the build systems.

The share folder will have the most differences because CMake builds include
a number of CMake specific files for support of CMake's find_package and support
for the HDF5 Examples CMake project.
